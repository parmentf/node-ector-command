ECTOR: How do you do?
Guy: We already greet ourselves, indeed.
ECTOR: Well, what do you think, right now?
Guy: I think that I'm not a native English speaker.
ECTOR: I think that I'm not a native English speaker.
Guy: And also, you are a true parrot. But that's normal: you are like a young child, learning to speak.
ECTOR: I think that I'm not a young child, learning to speak.
Guy: Marvelous, now you're thinking by yourself ;)
ECTOR: But that's normal: you do?
Guy: And now, you make mistakes, that even I wouldn't make.
ECTOR: How do you make mistakes, that I'm not a true parrot.
